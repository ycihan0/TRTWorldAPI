        "article": "US President Joe Biden has told campaign donors that he wasn’t sure he’d be running for reelection if Donald Trump wasn’t also in the race, saying that democracy is 'more at risk in 2024' and that the former president and his allies are out to 'destroy' democratic institutions.\n\nPresident Biden was using a trio of fundraisers on Tuesday to caution against what might happen should his predecessor again claim control of the White House, noting that Trump has described himself as his supporters’ 'retribution' and has vowed to root out 'vermin' in the country.\n\n'We’ve got to get it done, not because of me. ... If Trump wasn’t running, I’m not sure I’d be running. We cannot let him win,' Biden said, hitting the last words slowly for emphasis.\n\nBiden's forceful rhetoric came as Trump, the current GOP front-runner, who tried to overturn the 2020 election he lost and is facing criminal charges connected to those efforts, attempted over the weekend to turn the tables by calling Biden the 'destroyer of American democracy. \n\n American democracy, I give you my word as a Biden, is at stake,' the president said at the first of three campaign fundraisers in the Boston area.\n\nDrawing some laughter from donors, Biden also mused: 'He didn’t even show up at my inauguration. I can’t say I was disappointed, but he didn’t even show up.'\n\nThe warnings by Biden are increasingly part of his pitch to donors.\n\nThe president is pushing to raise money for his reelection effort before the end of the year, appearing at seven events through Monday — with more to come.",

        "article": "Global music star Ed Sheeran has shocked fans by announcing a surprise album set to drop next month.\n\nThe British singer-songwriter revealed the news during a live stream, saying, 'This is something I’ve been working on for a while, and I can’t wait for you all to hear it.' Sheeran, who has been relatively quiet on social media in recent months, hinted that this project is deeply personal and different from his previous works.\n\nAccording to sources close to the artist, the album will feature a mix of acoustic ballads and experimental sounds, blending Sheeran’s signature storytelling with fresh musical influences. Some industry insiders suggest that collaborations with major artists, including Taylor Swift and Justin Bieber, may be part of the record.\n\n'I've poured my heart into this album. Every song tells a story from my life over the past few years, from love and loss to rediscovering myself as an artist,' Sheeran shared in an interview. He also mentioned that he has written over 50 songs for the project, but only a select few made the final cut.\n\nFans have already begun speculating about the tracklist, with some hoping for a return to Sheeran’s early acoustic style while others anticipate a more upbeat, radio-friendly sound. Music critics predict that the album could break streaming records, given Sheeran's history of dominating charts worldwide.\n\nThe announcement has sent social media into a frenzy, with hashtags like #NewEdSheeranAlbum trending within minutes. Fans from around the world expressed their excitement, with many saying they couldn’t wait to hear what Sheeran has in store.\n\nIn addition to the album, Sheeran hinted at a possible world tour, though no official dates have been confirmed yet. 'I miss performing live, and I can’t wait to get back on stage to share these new songs with you all,' he said, further fueling speculation about a major concert announcement.\n\nWith the album’s release just weeks away, expectations are high, and Sheeran seems ready to deliver yet another masterpiece that will captivate audiences globally.",
